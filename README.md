## My process

1. First, I looked through the designs and started writing down tags that would be appropriate for each section of the QR Component.

2. I typed out the HTML structure of the page.

3. then I started adding styles until the QR Component looked very close to the original design.

4. I initialized the project as a public repository on GitHub.

5. And then configured the repository to publish the code to a web address.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Working on this project helped reinforce my knowledge on CSS Box Model, I learned more about Flexbox and now have a special preference of when to use CSS Grid in a project(which I didn't make use of in this project).

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
body {
    font-family: "Outfit";
    background-color: lightblue;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    font-size: 15px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS FlexBox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
